# Number Guessing Game with JavaScript

At the most recent freeCodeCamp meetup, we all attempted some challenges in JavaScript. First, we tested out the Math library and how to save the value of some input and make sure it's saved as a number. Then we moved on to conditionals to check whether the guess was not a number, was too high, was too low, or was correct. Last, we added the result to a paragraph tag using its id.

On my own, I added a counter that would only allow the user to have 10 chances to guess the number.

In the future, I want to complete the rest of the challenges and add a design to the page.
